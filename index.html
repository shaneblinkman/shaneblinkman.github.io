            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Person Summary</h3>
            <p> As a second-year master's student at Stanford University's School of Engineering, I am advancing my studies in mechanical engineering with a concentration in mechatronics. I completed my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at Stanford, specializing in dynamic systems and controls, and completed four years as a varsity athlete and captain of the Men's Swim Team.
            </p>
            <p>
            Throughout my five years at Stanford, I've gained extensive hands-on experience in diverse engineering projectsâ€”from designing a wearable rehabilitative device for children with spastic cerebral palsy to building autonomous systems that integrate mechanical, electrical, and software components. My passion lies in robotics and embedded systems, particularly in expanding my knowledge of computer vision, motion planning, and PCB design.
            </p>
            <p>With a robust foundation in dynamic systems mechanics, my technical toolkit spans mechanical (SolidWorks, prototyping, manufacturing), electrical (PCB design, embedded systems, signal processing), and software domains (C/C++, Python, MATLAB).
            </p>
            <h3>Career Objective</h3>
            <p>Seeking to apply my interdisciplinary skill set to innovative, interdisciplinary projects. I thrive in fast-paced environments where team members are empowered to drive projects from conception to completion.
